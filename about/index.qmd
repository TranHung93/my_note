:::

My background is in pharmacy and medicine, but I have a strong interest in math and related fields. When I studied biostatistics at my former universities, I realized how important it is in medical and pharmaceutical sciences. I joined OUCRU's biostatistics department and learned a lot from my great teacher, Prof. Ronald, as well as my supervisor, Dr. Duc, and my best friend, Dr. Trinh.

When I wrote these words, I was still quite new to this fieldâ€”about a year with R and six months with Quarto. The purpose of this blog is to keep track of my learning journey and, hopefully, share my thoughts with others. I am happy to learn from my mistakes.

Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:thaihung.tran306@gmail.com) if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects.
